Lego images classification:
we were given training data consisting of lego block images taken in different angles and were asked to predict the classification of the test data.
I used convoution networks for training.
I did two trainings using image genaraator for data augmentation and another training without augmentation.The final result is saved in the Testfinal.csv file. I run different models in the code and both took about 8 to 10 minutes to run.
